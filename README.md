## Overview

DiskSight provides comprehensive visibility into storage consumption patterns across your file system. Unlike conventional disk analyzers, DiskSight employs a multi-threaded scanning engine written in Rust, delivering analysis speeds up to 10x faster than traditional tools while maintaining a minimal memory footprint.

The application features three distinct visualization modes: an interactive treemap for spatial analysis, a hierarchical directory tree for structural navigation, and a tabular view for detailed file-level inspection. Real-time progress tracking and intelligent caching ensure a responsive user experience even when analyzing drives with millions of files.

---

## Key Features

### High-Performance Scanning Engine
- Multi-threaded file system traversal using Rust's `ignore` crate
- Optimized directory walking with configurable depth limits
- Intelligent filtering to skip system directories and reduce scan time
- Real-time progress updates with minimal overhead

### Visualization Modes
- **Treemap**: Proportional area visualization for instant size comparison
- **Directory Tree**: Hierarchical navigation with expand/collapse functionality
- **File Table**: Sortable tabular view with detailed metadata

### Smart Delete System
- Three-tier safety classification: AutoDelete, ConfirmRequired, Protected
- Automatic identification of temporary files, caches, and build artifacts
- System file protection to prevent accidental deletion of critical files
- Recycle Bin integration for safe file removal

### File Type Analytics
- Aggregated statistics by file extension
- Visual distribution charts
- One-click filtering to view files of specific types
- Export capabilities for storage audits

### User Experience
- Dark and Light theme support with system preference detection
- Responsive design adapting to various window sizes
- Context menu integration for quick file operations
- Keyboard shortcuts for power users

## Configuration

### Application Settings

Access via the settings icon in the header or `Ctrl+,`

| Setting | Default | Description |
|---------|---------|-------------|
| Theme | Light | Interface color scheme (Light/Dark/System) |
| Scan Threads | 4 | Parallel workers for file traversal |
| Max Depth | 32 | Maximum directory recursion depth |
| Include Hidden | false | Scan hidden files and directories |
| Show Empty Folders | false | Display zero-byte directories |

### Performance Tuning

For large drives (1TB+), consider:

```javascript
// Recommended settings for enterprise storage
{
  scanThreads: 8,
  maxDepth: 24,
  includeHidden: false,
  includeSystemDirs: false
}
```

## Performance

### Benchmark Results

Tested on Windows 11, AMD Ryzen 7 5800X, NVMe SSD:

| Drive Size | Files | Scan Time | Memory Usage |
|------------|-------|-----------|--------------|
| 256 GB | 180,000 | 4.2s | 120 MB |
| 512 GB | 420,000 | 8.7s | 180 MB |
| 1 TB | 890,000 | 18.3s | 280 MB |
| 2 TB | 1,800,000 | 42.1s | 450 MB |

### Optimization Notes

- Directories excluded by default: `Windows`, `System32`, `node_modules`, `.git`
- Progress updates throttled to 50ms intervals to minimize UI overhead
- Incremental tree updates batched in groups of 2,000 entries
- Memory-mapped file metadata for reduced I/O operations
